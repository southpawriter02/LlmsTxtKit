# Design Specification

**Status:** 🔲 Not started
**Target completion:** Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2)

---

> This document will define the architecture, component responsibilities, data flow, dependency choices, and rationale for key design decisions in LlmsTxtKit. It answers the question: *how is this built and why was it built this way?*
>
> For the high-level architecture overview, see the [project proposal](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llmstxt-research/blob/main/PROPOSAL.md) (Project 2 § Architecture Overview).
> For tech stack rationale, see the [Unified Roadmap](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llmstxt-research/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) § Tech Stack Rationale.
